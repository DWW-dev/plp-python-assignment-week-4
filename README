# üìÇ File Reader & Modifier ‚Äì Python Assignment

## üìñ Overview
This Python program demonstrates **file handling with error management**.  
It asks the user for a filename, reads the file content, displays it, modifies the content (by converting all text to uppercase), and writes the modified version into a new file named **`modified_output.txt`**.  

The program also includes robust **error handling** to manage issues such as:
- File not found  
- Permission errors  
- Unexpected runtime errors

- Reads and displays the file‚Äôs original content  
- Converts the content to **uppercase**  
- Saves the modified content into a new file (**`modified_output.txt`**)
