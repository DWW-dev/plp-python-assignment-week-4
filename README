This README file outlines a simple Python script that reads a text file, converts its content to uppercase, and writes it to a new file named modified_output.txt. The script includes error handling for cases where the file doesn't exist or there are issues with reading or writing files. The project requires Python 3.6 or higher and can be run on the command line after cloning the repository. Users can contribute by forking the repository, creating a new branch, making changes, and raising a pull request.If you have any questions, you can open an issue or contact the author. The script assumes the target file resides in the same directory as the script unless a full path is specified.
